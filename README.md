## MAGD150Project

This repository will contain work from throughout the semester that I have made (first 5 assignments) and will be shown on the github.io site.

### Project 1

In this project we were supposed to follow the task of making a building so I used a square and a few ellipses to make a small little gas station.

### Project 2

In this project I was asked to design planets so with that I made planets with stars along with a pie cut out of what looks to be the moon, along a ring around one of the planets.

### Project 3

This project we were asked to follow a theme of bubbles, so in it i put a blue backround to make the bubbles look like there were floating through the sky. With this I also added lines that would only allow two of the gray circles to move a certian distance, and finally the bubbles move with the users mouse.

### Project 4 

Here in this project you will find that we were asked to follow a theme of pizza, what I have done in it was add a weird moving background but along with this you will see a square pizza. However it does not always remain square, it changes to a circle when you click your mouse, and along with that when you click a key on your keyboard the cheese changes to sasuage.

### Project 5

Lastly, Project 5 asked fore us to follow a theme of television, and with this you will find a code that will display a tv. However this is not just a ordinary tv as you can actually click on the tv's button and it will change the color of the screen.
